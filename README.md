# Wormhole-Account-Abstraction-Relayer
This is a project that enables the Wormhole Client-Side Relayer to have ERC-4337 Compatibility. 

The Wormhole-Account-Abstraction Relayer intends to achieve two broad aims:
1. Enable Users sign transactions with an ERC-4337 compatible Wallet. This is also a Smart Contract Wallet and allows users the benefits of smart contract wallet functionality
2. Enable users to delegate payment of transaction fees to a Paymaster smart contract.
