# WORMHOLE ACCOUNT-ABSTRACTION(ERC-4337 COMPATIBLE) CLIENT SIDE RELAYER
This is a project that enables the Wormhole Client-Side Relayer to have ERC-4337 Compatibility. 

The Wormhole-Account-Abstraction (AA) Relayer intends to achieve two broad aims:
1. Enable Users sign transactions with an ERC-4337 compatible Wallet. This is also a Smart Contract Wallet and allows users the benefits of smart contract wallet functionality
2. Enable users to delegate payment of transaction fees to a Paymaster smart contract.

OVERVIEW
Client Side Relayers face two key problems. They are as follows:
1. Users must sign all transactions with their wallets.
2. Users must have funds to pay the transaction fees on every chain involved.
As could be expected, this can very problematic for new users as it requires accessing a wallet, getting acquainted with signing transactions and obtaining native tokens. The complicated UX/UI intefaces of many wallets deters several users. The Wormhole AA Client-Side Relayer mitigates these difficulties by giving users a range of signing options (multi sig, cryptographic signatures), social login options and sponosrship of transaction fees through a paymaster smart contract.This largely acheived by accessing the ecosystem of ERC-4337
